# TO-DO List Project

This is a simple TO-DO list project built with React.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TO-DO-List-Project.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd TO-DO-List-Project
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes, and you can also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed! See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
